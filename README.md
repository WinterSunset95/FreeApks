# FreeApks

Lets learn svelte and git together by building a fullstack application!!
If you're new to FOSS, feel free to contribute

## Before we start

You need to make sure you have the following installed:

```
git --version
```

# Setting up the project
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WinterSunset95/FreeApks
```
2. Go into the directory
```
cd FreeApks
```
3. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
4. Start the server
```
npm run dev --open
```

# Before editing
Before you start making changes to the codebase, make sure you are on your own branch. This is to avoid conflicting 
code across multiple programmers. Do not - under any circumstances - push to the main branch. Contributors will be 
assigned their own branches to work on. You will commit and push to your own branch, after which the owner will review and
merge the code.

Step by step guide:
1. Create your own branch
```
git branch YourOwnBranchNameHere
```
2. Go to your branch
```
git checkout YourOwnBranchNameHere
```
3. Write code, develop, suffer, lose brain cells
4. Commit your code
```
git add -A && git commit -m "This is a commit message, it should contain information about your changes"
```
5. Push to your branch
```
git push
```

# I shall handle the rest
## Peace
